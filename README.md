# machine_learning_final_project
Prediction of fatalities in Canadian motor vehicle collisions with machine learning models.

The aim of this project is to find if it is possible to predict whether fatalities will occur in motor vehicle accidents. 

In order to do it, we have studied every condition that could cause an accident, such as vehicle type, configuration of the road among others.
